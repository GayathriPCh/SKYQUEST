    <ol>
        <li>Set up your telescope one hour before viewing. This will help the optics adapt to the conditions. This is especially important in humid climates like Space City.</li>
        <li>Set up your telescope in a direction where the lens does not point toward any light from the ground (streetlight, house, passing cars, etc.).</li>
        <li>Find a flat surface for the tripod and adjust the tripods legs so that the telescope base is level.</li>
        <li>Turn off any lights in your vicinity, including indoor and outdoor house lights.</li>
        <li>Use a red-light flashlight and turn on red light setting on your phone or turn down the brightness.</li>
        <li>Twenty minutes before viewing, let your eyes adjust by not looking at bright screens like your TV or computer.</li>
        <li>Wipe off any eye piece or lens with a microfiber cloth.</li>
        <li>Use a stargazing app like Sky View or Stargazer to help find and identify objects and plan your viewing for the night. Make a schedule for the objects you want to view, and start with objects highest in the sky.</li>
        <li>Start observing by finding the brightest object in the sky, usually a bright star or planet.</li>
        <li>Focus on objects that appear high in the sky. Objects closer to the horizon wonâ€™t appear as clear due to atmospheric turbulence.</li>
        <li>When looking through the eye piece, avoid touching the telescope. This will cause the scope to move and possibly lose sight of the object. When not viewing directly, stay a few feet away from the telescope to avoid any accidents.</li>
        <li>View an object through eye piece for about 20 seconds then take a break for your eyes to adjust.</li>
